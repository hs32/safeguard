# Raspberry Pi setup

**Boot Raspberry Pi OS** 

- Connect a SD card with card reader at windows/ ubuntu pc
- Update your pi
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    
    ```
    
- Assign static IP to your pi
- via Pi config (if router doesn’t support DHCP reservation):
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    
    ```
    
- Add:
    
    ```
    interface eth0     # or wlan0 if WiFi
    static ip_address=192.168.1.50/24
    static routers=192.168.1.1
    static domain_name_servers=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
    
    ```
    
- Save → reboot:
    
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    
    ```

# Installation of Pi-hole

1. Update system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

```

1. Run Pi-hole installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash

```

1. During install:
    - Choose the network interface (`eth0` or `wlan0`).
    - Use the static IP you set.
    - Choose an upstream DNS (Cloudflare `1.1.1.1` recommended).
    - Enable web admin.
2. At the end, you’ll get:
    - Admin URL: `http://192.168.1.50/admin`
    - Auto-generated web password (copy this).

---

# Configure your network to use Pi-hole

Option A — Device-level:

- Change DNS on your laptop/phone to `192.168.1.50`.

Option B — Router-level:

- In your router’s DNS settings, set **primary DNS = 192.168.1.50**.
- This way, all devices on your LAN use Pi-hole automatically.

✅ Enable Pi-hole API

1. Log into web interface → **Settings → API / Web Interface**.
2. Enable API.
3. Copy your **API Token** — you’ll use this later with Cloudflare Tunnel + Dokploy/Render.

✅ At this point you have a

**working Pi-hole running locally**

.

From here, we’ll extend it with

**Cloudflare Tunnel**

so you can programmatically update allow/block lists from your VPS/Dokploy/Render without worrying about dynamic IP.

# Get the Pi-hole’s access at public internet (through Cloudflare tunnel)

### 🔹 Step 1:  Download the latest `cloudflared`

Check your Pi’s architecture first:

```bash
uname -m

```

- If it says `aarch64` → you need the **arm64** package.
- If it says `armv7l` → you need the **armhf** package.

Now download the correct `.deb`:

```bash
# For 64-bit Pi OS (arm64)
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb

# For 32-bit Pi OS (armhf)
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-armhf.deb

```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Install it

```bash
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-*.deb

```

If it complains about missing dependencies, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get -f install -y

```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Verify installation

```bash
cloudflared --version

```

You should see the installed version.

---

👉 After this, you can continue with:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login

```

to authenticate with Cloudflare and create your tunnel.

---

⚡ Bonus: If you just want a **quick test without a Cloudflare account/domain**, you can run:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:80

```

It will give you a temporary `https://something.trycloudflare.com` URL that exposes your Pi-hole dashboard securely to the internet.

### 🔹 Step 4:  create a **persistent tunnel** that exposes Pi-hole’s admin/API over HTTPS

Now we’ll create a **persistent tunnel** that exposes Pi-hole’s admin/API over HTTPS (either on a subdomain you own, or via a temporary `trycloudflare.com` URL), configure ingress so *only* `/admin` (and the API) is exposed, and install the tunnel as a service so it auto-starts.

I’ll give two clear paths (pick one): **A. Permanent tunnel with your Cloudflare domain** (recommended) and **B. Quick temporary `trycloudflare.com` test**. Both assume Pi-hole’s web UI is reachable locally at `http://localhost/admin` (Pi-hole uses lighttpd on port 80 by default).

**A — Permanent tunnel (use your Cloudflare domain)**

Use this if you control a Cloudflare domain (example: `yourdomain.com`) and want a stable subdomain like `pihole.yourdomain.com`.

1. **Create the named tunnel**

```bash
# run on the Pi (you already logged in)
cloudflared tunnel create pihole-tunnel

```

This prints a tunnel ID and places credentials in `~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json`.

1. **Create the cloudflared config**
    
    Create `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` with content (replace placeholders):
    

```bash
nano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml

```

```yaml
tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID_FROM_CREATE>
credentials-file: /home/hasan/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: pihole.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost/admin

  # optional: allow direct API endpoints (admin/api.php) explicitly
  - hostname: pihole.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost/admin/api.php

  # default rule for everything else
  - service: http_status:404

```

1. **Create DNS record in Cloudflare pointing the hostname to the tunnel**

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns pihole-tunnel pihole.yourdomain.com

```

This will create the necessary CNAME in your Cloudflare zone.

1. **Install the tunnel as a system service (auto-start)**

```bash
sudo cloudflared service install
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared

```

1. **Verify**

```bash
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
# then from anywhere:
curl -k https://pihole.yourdomain.com/admin/api.php

```

You should get the HTML of the admin page (or a 401/403 if Pi-hole expects auth). For API calls use the Pi-hole API token when posting to `/admin/api.php`.

**B — Quick temporary test (no domain required)**

If you don’t have a domain or want to test quickly, run a one-off tunnel to get a `trycloudflare.com` URL.

```bash
# quick ephemeral tunnel exposing local port 80
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:80

```

Output will include a `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com` URL you can use immediately. This is good for testing but not recommended as long-term because the URL can change unless you create a named tunnel.

To expose only /admin and not everything, do the named tunnel method with `config.yml` (Option A).

---

*Example: How to call Pi-hole API through the tunnel*

Assuming you set `PIHOLE_API_URL=https://pihole.yourdomain.com/admin/api.php` and you have the Pi-hole API token:

Add to allowlist (curl example):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -d "list=white&add=trusted.com&auth=YOUR_PIHOLE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://pihole.yourdomain.com/admin/api.php"

```

You should get a JSON response from Pi-hole confirming the change.

*Troubleshooting checklist*

- `cloudflared` service status:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status cloudflared
    sudo journalctl -u cloudflared -f
    
    ```
    
- Confirm the credentials file exists: `ls ~/.cloudflared/*.json`
- Confirm Pi-hole is reachable locally:
    
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost/admin -I
    
    ```
    
- If using your domain, ensure the Cloudflare zone for `yourdomain.com` is present in the same account you logged into.
- If you get 404 from the tunnel, check `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` ingress rules and order (first match wins).
- If Pi-hole admin requires extra auth, use the API token for programmatic calls (UI login is separate).

*Security note*

- The above config exposes only the `/admin` and `/admin/api.php` endpoints via the tunnel. Keep your Pi-hole API token secret. If you want extra lock-down, put basic auth or IP allow rules in cloudflared ingress (or restrict with Cloudflare Access/Zero Trust).

---

### 🔹 Step 5:  Run the Cloudflare config as system service (so it auto restarts at reboot)

Create the config file

Create a config file in `/etc/cloudflared/` (that’s where the service expects it):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflared
sudo nano /etc/cloudflared/config.yml

```

Paste this (replace `pihole.paradox-bd.com` with your domain):

```yaml
tunnel: e87bd965-4eba-41ea-82ee-d6ccf0efc936
credentials-file: /home/hasan/.cloudflared/e87bd965-4eba-41ea-82ee-d6ccf0efc936.json

ingress:
  - hostname: pihole.paradox-bd.com
    service: http://localhost:80
  - service: http_status:404

```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).

**Fix permissions**

Make sure the system user `cloudflared` can read the credentials:

```bash
sudo chown -R cloudflared:cloudflared /etc/cloudflared
sudo chown -R cloudflared:cloudflared /home/hasan/.cloudflared

```

**Install & enable the service**

Now install the tunnel as a service:

```bash
sudo cloudflared service install

```

Then enable & start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared

```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

```

**Test externally**

From any other device (even outside your LAN), try:

```bash
curl -I https://pihole.paradox-bd.com/admin

```

If everything worked, you’ll see `200 OK` or `302 Found` (Pi-hole web login).
